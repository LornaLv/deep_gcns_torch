# GIANT-XRT+RevGAT

This is the repository for reproducing the results in our paper: [[Node Feature Extraction by Self-Supervised Multi-scale Neighborhood Prediction]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00064.pdf) for the combination of GIANT-XRT+RevGAT.

## Step 0: Install GIANT and get GIANT-XRT node features.
Please follow the instruction in [[GIANT]](https://github.com/amzn/pecos/tree/mainline/examples/giant-xrt) to get the GIANT-XRT node features. Note that if you generate your own pretrained node features from GIANT-XRT, you should be aware of your save path and modify the --pretrain_path (below in Step 3) accordingly.

## Step 1: Git clone this repo.
After following the steps in [[GIANT]](https://github.com/amzn/pecos/tree/mainline/examples/giant-xrt), go to the folder
`pecos/examples/giant-xrt`

Then git clone this repo in the folder `giant-xrt` directly.

## Step 2: Install additional packages.
If you install and run GIANT correctly, you should only need to additionally install [dgl>=0.5.3](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl). See [here](https://www.dgl.ai/pages/start.html) for pip/conda installation instruction for dgl.

## Step 3: Run the experiment.
Go to the folder `deep_gcns_torch`.

Run `Runexp_RevGAT_ogbnarxiv.sh` for reproducing our results for ogbn-arxiv dataset with GIANT-XRT features.

```
New arguments

--data_root_dir: path to save ogb datasets.
--pretrain_path: path to load GIANT-XRT features. Set it to 'None' for using ogb default features.
``` 

## Results
If execute correctly, you should have the following performance (using our pretrained GIANT-XRT features).

|  | RevGAT | RevGAT+KD |
|---|---|---|
| Average val accuracy (%) | 77.01 ± 0.09 | 77.16 ± 0.09 |
| Average test accuracy (%) | 75.90 ± 0.19 | 76.15 ± 0.10 |

Number of params: 1304912

**Remark:** We do not carefully fine-tune RevGAT for our GIANT-XRT. It is possible to achieve higher performance by fine-tune it more carefully.

For more details about RevGAT, please check the original README.
